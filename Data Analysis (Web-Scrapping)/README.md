# Data-analysis (Web-Scrapping-)

## Tech Used

▶️ Jupyter Notebook <br/>
▶️ requests <br/>
▶️ BeautifulSoup <br/>
▶️ pandas <br/>
▶️ matplotlib <br/>
▶️ seaborn <br/>

## Task Performed 

▶️ Data was acquired through the 'requests' library, and subsequent data structuring was achieved with 'BeautifulSoup' to extract the necessary table from the webpage. <br/>
▶️ Utilizing 'pandas,' a robust data frame was established, forming the basis for subsequent analyses. <br/>
▶️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) uncovered data type inconsistencies, specifically, all variables were initially recognized as objects. Addressing this, the 'pd.to_numeric' function from Pandas was employed to rectify type errors associated with numerical data. <br/>
▶️ Post-resolution of type discrepancies, visualizations were crafted using 'matplotlib' and 'seaborn.' Key visuals include graphs highlighting the top 10 companies by revenue and the distribution of revenue across industries, offering insightful perspectives on the dataset. <br/>
